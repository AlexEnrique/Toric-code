# Toric code observables

This is an old project, made at the beginning of 2020, to finish a scientific initiation project. 
It consists in the numerical simulation of [Kitaev's Toric Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toric_code), studied in [Quantum Error Correction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_error_correction) 
and [Fault Tolerant Quantum Compuation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/9712048.pdf). 
More specifically, the program simulates the ground state of the Toric Code in the presence of a transverse field perturbation to see a 
topological phase transition near the Ising transition point.

I implemented the simulation using the [D Programming Language](https://dlang.org/), which I really love. It was choosen because I desired a fast language with high-level functionalities.
